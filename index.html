      <h1> Nearly 5000 retail stores will be closed in 2019. But, many retail workers are here to stay </h1>



      <p> The announced shutdown of 2,500 stores by Payless Shoe Source will lead to loss of 18,000 jobs. Gymboree Group Inc., a children apparel retailer will shut operations of two of its subsidiaries, effectively terminating jobs of 9,600
        employees. </p>



      <p> Even as many blue-collar workers lose their jobs, economists believe they are less affected than white-collar workers. There is enough fluidity in the retail sector for a blue-collared worker to be rehired again by another retail store. In
        the past months, many retail giants have actually made big moves to attract these laid-off employees. </p>



      <p> For example, Walmart now offers its employees bonuses for good attendance and Target recently raised its minimum wage to $13. </p>





      <p>It's just mid-April and already 11 stores have announced closures. Let’s calculate how many workers in the stores you recently visited will lose their jobs.<sup>*</sup></p>

      <p> “This is not the end of retail,” said Mike Montgomery, Senior Economist, IHS Markit. “The market is so fluid that you have people moving from one store to another.” </p>


      <p> However, it has been more difficult for a white-collar worker to find a job. “That’s the point of mergers and acquisitions to reduce white collar jobs and become more efficient,” says Montgomery. </p>

      <p> Andrew Zatlin, founder of SouthBay Research says that blue-collar workers have a lot of choices. “Same job, different place.” </p>



      <p> However, when malls close the foot traffic goes to the nearby store. For example, when a Circuit City closes, people head to close by Best Buy. But, Best Buy doesn’t need more accountants or marketing workers, what they need is more floor
        salesperson, as per Zaitlin.</p>
