      <h1> As the retail apocalypse continues, not all retail workers will find shelter </h1>

      <h2> By Karishma Vanjani
      </h2>

      <p> Karina Sanchez, a cashier at a Payless ShoeSource store looks forward to her upcoming family vacation even as next month she would effectively be unemployed. Payless ShoeSource, like many other retailers this year, announced the closure of
        all its 2,500 stores effectively terminating 18,000 jobs. However, for some of these workers, not all is lost.</p>

      <p> “Managers from right opposite [Macy’s] and even from Old Navy are coming to us,” said Sanchez when asked about her plans of joining other retailers. “Many employees have already found other jobs and left the store.” </p>

      <p> The high employee turnover rates and labor market shortages of retail store workers makes it easy for a front-line worker to be rehired by another retail store. As per labor force statistics, employment of sales floor associates in the
        retail trade industry dropped by 1,45,000 from 2014 to 2018 whereas management, business, and financial operations occupations went up by 49,000. While, most cashiers and store clerks are finding other retail store jobs due to the their
        decreasing numbers, the overall labor market is much tighter for more skilled employees working at the headquarter level. </p>

      <p> “When companies go under completely, people at the headquarters need to find new jobs as well,” said Greg Buzek, founder and president of IHL Group, a research firm for the retail and hospitality industries. “And, they often take longer
        than
        the people working at the sales floor.” </p>

      <p>
        As the population of working-age individuals with a bachelor’s degree continues to grow in the U.S., laid-off employees in the IT, HR, merchandising and supply chain divisions of retail have to compete with a larger pool of skilled labor
        force to find jobs in the same sector. The share of the working-age population with a college degree is uninterruptedly growing at about 2% annually, the share without a bachelor’s degree is shrinking, as per a Conference Board study. The
        continuing growth puts an upward pressure on the supply of workers for positions that require a higher educational credential.
      </p>


      <p>
        Support staff, accountant and manager positions tend to attract workers with college degrees and there’s more supply of those workers available right now as their numbers are growing says Brian Schaitkin, senior economist of the Conference
        Board. </p>
      <div class=img-resize>

      </div>

      <p>

        Adding to that in retail, these jobs are concentrated in one area and hence, when a chain decides to either downsize or shut its operations completely, corporate office workers may have to relocate to find jobs.

      </p>


      <p>
        People that are working at the store level often have very many more options that are out there for jobs says Buzek. “But, if headquarter workers lose their jobs at Oshkosh, Wisconsin those jobs may not be available there, they may have to
        move to get a similar job.” he adds.


      </p>
      <p>Relocation might be the only way for headquarter workers, especially in smaller cities, to find jobs.

      </p>
      <p> For example, those seeking management specific positions in retail companies in Houston can join the corporate headquarters of Kirkland & Ellis, H-E-B or Francesca. However, retail management workers in cities without large presence of
        local private retail employers would have to relocate.</p>
      <!-- <p>It's just mid-April and already 11 stores have announced closures. Let’s calculate how many workers in the stores you recently visited will lose their jobs.<sup>*</sup></p> -->
      <p> CVS health that has its headquarters in Woonsocket, Rhode Island recently announced 46 store closures. If laid-off, the headquarter workers in this location will neither have local job opportunities nor the support of a union that
        frontline sales workers enjoy.
      </p>
      <p> Most sales jobs are unionized but professional retail jobs are not.
      </p>
      <div class=img-resize>
        <img src="Images/Management.png" />
      </div>

      <p> Unions are known to protect workers under the job retention or survivorship clause in the contract. As per BLS stats, professional union membership grew to 6.18 million in 2018, an increase of almost 28,000 from 2017. While more and more
        professional or technical class employees are adopting the union way, the group is still far from getting bargaining rights.
      </p>
      <p>“We don’t represent IT or call-center jobs in retail,” said Chelsea Connor, director of communications at Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). “Those workers just like anybody else when a store closes would have to seek
        other jobs.”
      </p>
      <p> The pressure on a freshly laid-off financial operations retail worker also comes from the changing dynamics of this industry. Along with closures, the drove of mergers and acquisitions have affected these jobs.
      </p>
      <p> “When companies are doing mergers, it is more often that the administrative people that suffer,” said Mike Montgomery, Senior Economist, IHS Markit. To increase efficiency people running the ‘computer-centers’ work for two-stores instead
        of one, he added.
      </p>
      <p> A fluid retail market only applies to front-line workers. Sanchez plans to look for a job after she’s back from a holiday and she stands safe to do so. In the past months, many retail giants have actually made big moves to attract these
        laid-off employees. For example, Walmart now offers its employees bonuses for good attendance and Target recently raised its minimum wage to $13.
      </p>
      <p> Front-line workers have a lot of choices says Andrew Zatlin, founder of SouthBay Research. “Same job, different place.” But, when a mall closes the foot traffic goes to the nearby store and stores like a Best Buy need more floor
        salespeople to manage the additional crowd not another accountant or marketing representative, he adds.
      </p>
      <p> Despite, the rash of store closures, employment in the retail sector has changed little in the past two years. This is quite troubling for the sector given how strong the economy is in general. The flatlined growth comes at a time when
        the economy is adding almost 205,000 jobs per month.
      </p>
      <p> This change in landscape could be highly disruptive for both classes of workers - front-line and back-end. Many factors, however, point at back-end office workers being left further behind.
