      <h1> As the retail apocalypse continues, both blue and white collar retail workers don’t find shelter in the same space </h1>



      <p> Karina Sanchez, a cashier at a Payless ShoeSource store looks forward to the upcoming family vacation even though next month she would effectively be unemployed. Payless ShoeSource like many other retailers this year announced the closure
        of all its 2,500 stores, thereby terminating 18,000 blue and white collar jobs. However, for some of these workers, not all is lost.
      </p>



      <p> “Managers from right opposite [Macy’s] and even from Old Navy are coming to us,” said Sanchez when asked about her plans of joining other retailers. “Many employees have already found other jobs and left the store.”

    <p>
      Some trends are starting to take shape. As per a BLS report, of all retail workers that lost their jobs between 2015-2017, 37% were re-employed in the same sector in January 2018. The number for workers displaced between 2015-2017 was only
      slightly lower at 34%. There is enough fluidity in the retail sector for a blue-collared worker to be rehired by another retail store. However, things are not the same for a white-collar worker.
    </p>


    <p>
      Blue-collar workers have a lot of choices says Andrew Zatlin, founder of SouthBay Research. “Same job, different place.” But, he adds, when a mall closes the foot traffic goes to the nearby store and stores like a Best Buy need more floor
      salespeople to manage the additional crowd not another accountant or marketing rep. </p>

    <p>

      A fluid retail market only applies to blue-collared workers. Sanchez plans to look for a job after she’s back from a holiday and as per Zaitlin’s explanation she stands safe to do so. In the past months, many retail giants have actually made
      big moves to attract these laid-off employees. For example, Walmart now offers its employees bonuses for good attendance and Target recently raised its minimum wage to $13.
    </p>


    <p>
      While Walmart, the country’s largest employer ensures a displaced retail worker finds hope at a retail store’s sales floor again, it has been difficult for a white-collar worker to find a job during this retail apocalypse “That’s the point
      of mergers and acquisitions to reduce white collar jobs and become more efficient,” said Mike Montgomery, Senior Economist, IHS Markitntgomery.
